# aps-360-labs

This repository contains the code for all the labs I completed during APS360 (Fundamentals of Deep Learning) course.

## Lab 1 PyTorch and ANNS
This lab deals with practice for basic Python and several PyTorch functionalities. Also practiced Hyperparameter Tuning on a Simple 2 Layer ANN for classification on the MNIST Dataset, achieving highest test accuracy of 94%.

## Lab 2 Cats vs Dogs
This lab contains a 2 layer and 1 layer CNN Model trained on CIFAR10 Dataset for Cats vs Dogs Classification. Models achieves a peak test accuracy of 72%. Also built a simple 2 layer ANN as baseline model to compare results with the CNN Models.

## Lab 3 Gesture Recognition (ASL Dataset)
Implemented a LeNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and also utilized Transfer Learning using Pre-trained AlexNet to perform Gesture Recognition on the American Sign Language Dataset, achieving test accuracies of 92.8% and 93.41% respectively.

## Lab 4 Data Imputation
Built a simple baseline model along with an Autoencoder to perform data imputation on the UCI Adult Dataset. 

## Lab 5 Spam Detection
Utlized character level Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to perform Sentiment Analysis and detect Spam Messages using the UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset, achieving a final test accuracy of 98%.
